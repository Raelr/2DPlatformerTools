# UntitledPlatformerProject
This is a basic Unity project featuring platformer mechanics within a lovecraftian theme. The idea of the project is twofold: to experiment with both platformer physics and thematic art. The project is intended to be a small experiment with creating custom platformer physics and level editing capabilities into Unity.
